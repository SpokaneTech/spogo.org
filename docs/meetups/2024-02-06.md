## FUSE and Go - Userspace File Systems for fun and profit

* Event: https://www.meetup.com/spokane-go-users-group/events/298483713

## Agenda

Have you ever thought: wouldn't it be great if I could mount my [ s3 bucket | KV cache store | FTP server ] on my file system so I can just drag and drop files there? Well....with a little go code, you can! We'll run over the basics of what user space file systems are and how you can implement one in go.

We'll try to balance a more technical dive into kernel interactions and the `/dev/fuse` device with a higher level practical implementation using some great packages that handle a lot of the nuances for you.
