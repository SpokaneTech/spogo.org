## Orchestration as a Service

## Agenda

Brennon will present on his personal vendetta against how hard it is to host a stupid cheap container in a public cloud. We will talk about all the different ways to do docker networking, overlay networks, and sidecar containers. Finally he will present the code and, fingers crossed, a live demo to actually schedule some containers.

A special shout out to Rob Martinson and [limelyte.com](limelyte.com) for providing a place for us all to meet!
