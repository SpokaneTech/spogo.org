# Meetup on 2024-12-03

* https://www.meetup.com/spokane-go-users-group/events/304227409

## Agenda

We will start the event with a bit of a workshop helping everyone get their Pi Pico W setup, building, and connected to the network. There will be a few lessons that we can do together to experiment with connectivity. The rest of the meetup we will just be messing around with the device, playing with some peripherals that will be provided and socializing.

## What to bring?

* A working laptop
* A USB-C-to-micro-USB cable (if you have one)
* If you have a Pico W, bring it! If you don't, no worries we will have one for you to use.
