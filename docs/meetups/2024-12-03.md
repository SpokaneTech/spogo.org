## Agenda

We will start the event with a bit of a workshop helping everyone get their Pi Pico W setup, building, and connected to the network. There will be a few lessons that we can do together to experiment with connectivity. The rest of the meetup we will just be messing around with the device, playing with some peripherals that will be provided and socializing.
