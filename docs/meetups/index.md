## Ideas for future meetup subjects and discussions 

* Using the [AWS SDK](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/)
* Building a CLI (Optionally with tools like Cobra,Viper or a TUI with Charm Bubbletea)
* Full-Stack web applications (Gin/Echo/Fiber, Gorm/Sql, html/template w/sprig)
* Authentication and Authorization (Goth, Google, Casbin/Casdoor)
* Cloud deployment (AWS Lambda, ECS/Fargate, GCP)
* Real world concurrency with goroutines (build a worker to process a large number of jobs, maybe image manipulation or some long running task)
