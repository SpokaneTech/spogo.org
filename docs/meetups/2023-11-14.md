## Rethinking APIs: Request-Response over a distributed message bus

* Event: https://www.meetup.com/spokane-go-users-group/events/296361124

## Agenda

When sitting down to build a new public api, we typically reach for the usual suspects: REST, GraphQL, RPC using some type of gateway / translation (grpc-web, connect) layer. (Please don't ask why I didn't include XML/SOAP in this list). What is it all these services have in common? They are built and accessed via HTTP. Which makes sense: HTTP as a transport is battle tested, ubiquitous, easy to reason about, and easy to debug.

But is there another way? One that eliminates the setup and management headache of CORS, proxies, load balancing, global caching, DNS, and service discovery? The short answer is YES! To find out what and how - join us!

This meetup will nominally be about go: the examples will all be in golang and the open source project we will be deploying and using is written in go, but fundamentally we'll be trying to explore an alternative way of building and interacting with a publicly accessible API.
