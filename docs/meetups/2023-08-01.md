## Let's Go! (Golang 101)

* Event: https://www.meetup.com/spokane-go-users-group/events/294578131

## Agenda

We're going to start at the beginning with a meetup designed to get everyone bootstrapped into the go ecosystem. This will be a zero-to-"hello world" event: if you are new to go or go curious this is the session for you! If you are an experienced go programmer, come along and help others!

We'll start by making sure everyone has go installed and run through the requirements to start a new go "module". We'll cover the basics: code organization, language conventions, and some of the philosophy / design decisions that have made go popular (hopefully igniting some flame wars along the way). This will all be hands on as we build a functioning app that you can compile and run (and will hopefully be a little more interesting than "hello world").

If you want to participate be sure to bring a laptop!
