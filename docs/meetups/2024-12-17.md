# Meetup on 2024-12-17

## Holiday Get Together With the Spokane Tech Community

* Event: https://www.meetup.com/spokane-go-users-group/events/304952676

## Agenda

Join us for a jolly good time as our tech community comes together to celebrate the holiday season in style! Whether you’re a coder, designer, tinkerer, or tech enthusiast, we’re all about festive cheer and good vibes.

This is a joint meetup with the .NET, Python, and Rust groups - it is a great opportunity to meet others in the Spokane tech world (and possibly start a flame war about which language is best....go, of course).

Bring your holiday spirit, your best tech jokes, and let’s make this a meetup to remember. We can’t wait to toast to another year of innovation, inspiration, and friendship. Cheers!

* Please RSVP so we can gauge whether or not to reserve space.
