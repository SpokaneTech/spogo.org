# Agenda

Brennon will be presenting on embedding and serving a NextJS typescript frontend along with a grpc backend all in a single compiled go binary. :mind-blown:

This talk will give you the foundations for the common pattern of embedding a Web UI in a golang cli. Beyond that you will get a taste for embedding things into go binaries, something that is easy, fun, and has may use cases (I've shipped a cli with an embedded psql binary!). You won't want to miss it!
