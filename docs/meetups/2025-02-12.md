## Mini-microservices workshop

* Event: https://www.meetup.com/spokane-go-users-group/events/305889927

## Agenda

In this workshop we will split into groups and attempt to setup a couple of microservices that all work together to accomplish a goal. Iâ€™m thinking we can implement a game of telephone and see what comes out the other side. In our exploration we will also play around withth a bit of service discovery, potentially using consul, to allow our services to register themselves and find each other.
