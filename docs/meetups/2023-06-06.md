## Agenda

Monthly Meetup! This is the inaugural event so we will aim to keep it light - get to know the community, gauge interest in topics, discuss meetup times going forward, etc.

If we have time I might kick off the presentations with something short:
Make + Go: using makefiles to supercharge your dev and deploy workflow.
