## Go 1.22 â€” ServeMux

* Event: https://www.meetup.com/spokane-go-users-group/events/303409967

## Agenda 

`net/http` had a glow up... and its name is `ServeMux`.

Is it time to kick Chi, Echo, and Gin to the curb? It just might be.

Go 1.22 came out recently and added some much needed improvements to the standard library's HTTP request multiplexer (mux). We'll explore these new additions and help you figure out if it's time to return to sweet, stdlib goodness for your HTTP 'plexing needs.

NOTE: This will be another joint meetup with the python user group and presentation by none other than inimitable and talented Joe Riddle! We will be meeting at IntelliTect.
