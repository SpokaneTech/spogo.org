## Project Structure In Go

* Event: https://www.meetup.com/spokane-go-users-group/events/294063849

## Agenda

Based on feedback from the last meetup we will be starting with some fundamental concepts, and what is more fundamental then how to structure your new go project?

We'll run through some standards and best practices that have emerged, as well as look at some small and large scale open source projects to get ideas on what might work and why. Finally we'll put it all together by building a small cli.

If you want to participate in the coding, bring a laptop with go installed. It will also be helpful to create a github account since we'll touch on source code management (time permitting).

Also bring your thoughts and ideas on project structure! Are you a mono-repo fan or do you hate them? Have you worked on a multi-language project and how did you manage it? How have you managed working on projects with lots of contributors? Let's talk and learn from each other's experience!
