**Description**
I love writing SQL as much as the next developer, but often times I want a tool that gives me strong typing with my SQL database. Enter: Object Relation Mapping libraries, or more succinctly, ORMs. There are many reasons to love ORMs that we'll discover by exploring Go's fantastic ORM, GORM.

In this talk, we'll cover three main ideas that will leave you ready to make the leap from SQL to ORM. We'll cover a brief overview of what an ORM is and to use one, followed by tackling a hands-on example of using GORM. We'll conclude with comparing GORM to other popular ORMs you may already be familiar with, like Django's (Python) and Entity Framework (C#).
